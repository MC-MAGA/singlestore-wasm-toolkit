# Setup

For each example in this tutorial, it will be useful to create yourself a separate work directory in which to put your code and compiled artifacts. This will help keep your files for each example organized.

In addition to a SQL client and SingleStore database, youâ€™ll need a few other things to get your environment set up properly. For this, you have some options:

- Use a [development container](Tutorial-Setup-Container.md) (recommended)
- Install development dependencies [locally](Tutorial-Setup-Local.md)
