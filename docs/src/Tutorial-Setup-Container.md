# Setting Up a Development Container

If you have a container runtime (e.g. Docker) available to you, the easiest way to get started is to utilize one of our prebuilt Wasm development containers.  To do this, first clone or download the [SingleStore WASM Toolkit](https://github.com/singlestore-labs/singlestore-wasm-toolkit) repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:singlestore-labs/singlestore-wasm-toolkit.git
```

The development containers provided in this repo contain all of the tools you'll need to write, build, and deploy Wasm UDFs.  Additionally, the repo also includes many examples, including fully-written versions of the examples referenced in this tutorial.  You may choose from the following containers, depending on your preferred workflow:

- [Visual Studio Code](Tutorial-Setup-Container-VSCode.md)
- [Standalone](Tutorial-Setup-Container-Standalone.md)

The exact setup for each of these is described in their respective sections.
