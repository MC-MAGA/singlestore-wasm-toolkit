# Wrap-Up

Well, this concludes our little tutorial.  In this tutorial, we learned how to turn some simple use cases into WebAssembly programs.  We then examined how to test them, load them into SingleStoreDB, and run them there.
    
Hopefully, this helps you kickstart the creation of your own Wasm UDFs and TVFs.  Thanks for tuning in!
