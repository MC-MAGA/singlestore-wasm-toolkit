# Examples

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through two different examples.

## `power-of`

This is a very small example that will show you the basics of creating a Wasm UDF.  In it, we will develop a program that computes x^y (that is, "x to the power of y").

You can get started on this tutorial [here](Tutorial-WIT-Power.md).

## `split-str`

This is a more advanced example in which we will write a Wasm TVF that splits a string into substring given a delimiting character.  It will show you how to develop a Wasm function that accepts and returns complex structures such as strings and records.
